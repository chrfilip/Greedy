# Greedy
Implementation of Community-based Greedy Algorithm for Mining Top-K Influential Nodes in Mobile Social Networks in Java Language
The algorithm encompasses two components: 
1) an algorithm for detecting communities in a social network by taking into account information diffusion; and 
2) a dynamic programming algorithm for selecting communities to find influential node.
